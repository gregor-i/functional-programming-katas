# Functional Programming Katas

## Getting started

0) install [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
1) execute `sbt` in this project folder.
2) select the kata you want to do with `project $projectname`. For example `project simple-lists`.
3) execute the tests with `test`. You may execute `~test` for continues test executions.

If you are stuck, you may take a look into the `solution` branch.

## Kata 1 - Simple Lists

Take a look into the `SimpleListSpec.scala` file. Uncomment the specs and implement your solution.
